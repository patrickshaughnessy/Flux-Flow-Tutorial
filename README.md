# Flux Flow Tutorial

This is a starter kit and example repo for [my blog post on setting up the React Flux flow](https://medium.com/@patrickshaughnessy/your-first-flux-flow-demystified-b7acdcb655a5 "link to blog post").

To follow along with my blog post, just clone this repo and you're good to go.

If you want to see the final product, clone this repo and then checkout the final branch

    git checkout final
